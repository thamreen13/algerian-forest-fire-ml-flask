# Flask Forest Fire Prediction

## Overview
A Flask web application that predicts the **Algerian Forest Fire Weather Index (FWI)** using a trained machine learning model.  
The app allows users to input environmental parameters and get a risk prediction for forest fires.

## Features
- Predict forest fire risk based on weather and environmental data
- Easy-to-use web interface built with Flask
- Scalable and deployable as a web app
- Uses StandardScaler for feature scaling and ML model for prediction

## Dataset
The app uses the **Algerian Forest Fires Dataset** with features such as:
- Temperature (Â°C)
- Relative Humidity (%)
- Wind speed (km/h)
- Rainfall (mm)
- FFMC, DMC, DC, ISI, BUI (forest fire indices)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flask-fire-prediction.git
